# Experiments.AI
---

This repository holds some of the experiments carried out using Machine Learning or Deep Learning to answer some of the questions I've had in my head. 

### Contributing
If you have ideas around these experiments with Machine Learning or Deep Learning practices, your contribution is very much welcomed. 
Contributing is a great way to learn more about social coding practices, new advancements in technologies and how to make something more constructive with 
helpful bug reports, feature requests and the noblest of all contributions: *a good, clean pull request*.
