## Which Classifier works best?
---

This comparative performance analysis of different classification algorithms is to 
identify which classifier performs best with which sort of data distribution.

The test evaluates the performance over training and validation set using a
10-fold Cross Validation approach; and currently only supports the following data distributions: 
- Linearly spearable dataset
- spirally distributed dataset and
- data distributed in concentric circular fashion.
